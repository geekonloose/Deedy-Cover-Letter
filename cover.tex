\lettercontent{Dear Prof. ,}

% The first paragraph of your job application letter should include information on why you are writing. Mention the job you are applying for and where you found the position. If you have a contact at the company, mention the person's name and your connection here.

\lettercontent{I am a PhD scholar working under the guidance of Prof. A. John Arul, Homi Bhabha National Institute (HBNI), Indira Gandhi Centre for Atomic Research, India. I plan to submit my Ph.D. thesis in December, 2022.}



% The next section of your cover letter should describe what you have to offer the company. Make strong connections between your abilities and the requirements listed in the job posting. Mention specifically how your skills and experience match the job. Expand on the information in your resume.
% Try to support each statement you make with a piece of evidence. Use several shorter paragraphs or bullets rather than one large block of text, which can be difficult to read and absorb quickly.
%For example 

% Using the knowledge and skills I have acquired in my <DEGREE PROGRAM> combined with my technical abilities I believe I can provide significant value to <COMPANY> while providing me invaluable experience to <PREPARE FOR OR FURTHER CAREER>.
% <RELEVANT LIFE STORY/ WORK/ PROJECT >
% In own projects, my coursework, work as a <PREVIOUS JOB TITLE> I have applied knowledge of <SUBJECT MATTER>.
% <LIST OF SMART SOUNDING SKILLS AND TOOLS>.
% Combining these tools with my interests in <FIELD> issues, I hope to help the <DEPARTMENT> answer questions about the <SUBJECT> behind <FIELD> projects.

\lettercontent{I have carried out my Ph.D. in severe accident analysis with
    prime focus on development of mechanistic model for the source term problem
    under severe accident conditions for an SFR. The work performed was part of
    IAEA CRP on "Radioactive Release from the Prototype Sodium cooled Fast
    Reactor under Severe Accident Conditions". During my Ph.D. tenure, I have
    developed/used both Python and OpenFOAM based tools to analyze in-vessel,
    interface and in-containment source term. For in-vessel assessment, I have
    developed two tools namely i) percolation based mechanistic model to
    determine fission gas release and ii) thermo-chemical equilibrium approach
    based tool MINICHEM to determine RN release to cover gas. The fission gas release model would be not only helpful to determine gap
    release under accident conditions, but would be helpful to locate failed
    fuel elements during reactor operation. The developed tool was also used to analyze the allowable
    failed fuel elements during reactor operation for Prototype Fast Breeder
    Reactor (PFBR). MINICHEM is python based tool to
    analyze RN release to cover gas which is available as an open source at
    \href{https://github.com/parthigcar/MINICHEM}{GitHub}.}

\lettercontent{For the interface and in-containment source term, where the
    dynamics of aerosol evolution and release are of the importance, I have
    developed python based tool with capability to analyze the aerosol evolution
    with time. The model is available as an open source at 
    \href{https://github.com/parthigcar/PANDICA}{GitHub}.
    Further, by utilizing the capability of OpenFOAM, I have performed 3D
    simulations for the cover gas and containment facilities (scaled experimental
    facilities) in order to have realistic feedback of aerosol evolution during
    accident conditions (using aerosolEulerFoam).}

% Conclude your application letter by thanking the employer for considering you for the position. 

\lettercontent{I am extremely eager to pursue a post-doctoral research on any
    challenging problems towards development of multiscale and multiphysics simulation for future
    generation reactors and related research topics. My formal training,
    academic background and research experience should permit me to carry on my
    work in any research problem related to safety analysis.
    % fission gas release, coupled
    % neutronic-thermal hydraulics problems and aerosol related problems
    My field of research interests matches with the work carried out in your
    research group on development of multiphysics solver for the estimation of
    the fission gas release from the fuel elements. I would like to work on
    research problems related to development of 3-D fuel performance code using
    OpenFOAM. As an aspiring researcher I ensure that I will give my best to
    provide innovative solution towards task given to me and work hard in order
    to probe my self worthy. }

\lettercontent{I will be happy to provide you with any additional information that is necessary to support my application. Looking forward to hearing from you. }
